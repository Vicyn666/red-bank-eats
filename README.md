## Project Purpose:

This app provides a listing of Restaurants in Red Bank, New Jersey.   The project was built for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## How to Load the App
You can run a hosted version of the app at TBD

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter.  If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
```
git clone https://github.com/sarah-maris/reactnd-project-myreads.git
npm install
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
